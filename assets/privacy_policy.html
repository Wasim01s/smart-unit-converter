    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Smart Unit Converter</strong> ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Effective date:</strong> <span id="effectiveDate">2025-11-27</span></p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
    <p>When you use the app, you may provide information such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account information (if you sign in using Firebase Auth) — e.g., email, display name.</li>
      <li>Purchase & billing information managed by Google Play (we do not directly collect credit card details).</li>
      <li>Conversion history you choose to save or export/import as CSV/JSON.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>We may automatically collect certain information about your device and usage, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device model, OS version, and app version.</li>
      <li>Crash reports and performance metrics (for debugging and improving the app).</li>
      <li>IP address and network information for API requests (currency rates).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Third-Party Data</h3>
    <p>We use third-party services which may collect data in accordance with their own privacy policies (see "Third-Party Services" below).</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the app’s features (conversion engine, currency rates, history).</li>
      <li>To process purchases and manage subscriptions via Google Play Billing.</li>
      <li>To store and sync data for premium users to Firestore when cloud sync is enabled.</li>
      <li>To show ads (if you are not a premium user) and to manage ad personalization preferences.</li>
      <li>To analyze usage and improve app performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Currency Rates & Caching</h2>
    <p>We fetch currency exchange rates from a public API. Rates are cached locally on-device (Hive) with a timestamp so the app can operate offline. Cached rates are stored only on your device unless you are a premium user and have enabled cloud sync.</p>

    <h2>4. Ads & Personalization</h2>
    <p>We integrate Google AdMob for displaying ads. Ads may be personalized based on device identifiers and preferences.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ad Personalization Toggle:</strong> You can control personalized ads via the app's Settings — toggle personalization on/off.</li>
      <li><strong>GDPR Notice:</strong> For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), we will request consent for personalized ads where required. If you decline personalized ads, non-personalized ads may still be shown.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Subscriptions & Purchases</h2>
    <p>Subscriptions (monthly/yearly) are processed by Google Play. Purchase records are available through Google Play and the app will check and restore purchases via the in_app_purchase API. We may store minimal subscription state (e.g., <code>isPremiumUser</code>) locally and, if enabled, in your Firestore user document for cross-device sync.</p>

    <h2>6. Storage & Security</h2>
    <p>Local storage: We store app settings, history, theme unlocks, and cached rates locally using Hive and SharedPreferences.</p>
    <p>Cloud storage: For premium users, optional sync uses Firebase Auth and Firestore. <strong>Do not</strong> store sensitive personal information in free-text history if you do not want it synced to the cloud.</p>
    <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your data; however, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access the personal data the app holds about you.</li>
      <li>Export your history (CSV/JSON) via the app.</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your data from our cloud (premium sync) by contacting us at the email below.</li>
      <li>Withdraw consent for personalized ads where applicable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This app may use the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google AdMob — for advertising. (AdMob Privacy Policy applies.)</li>
      <li>Firebase (Auth, Firestore) — for cloud sync and authentication.</li>
      <li>exchangerate.host or similar — for currency rates API.</li>
      <li>Google Play Billing — for managing subscriptions and purchases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please review each provider's privacy policy for details about their data practices.</p>

    <h2>9. Children</h2>
    <p>The app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided such information, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

    <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your local data until you delete the app or manually clear history. If you use cloud sync, we retain synced data until you request deletion or your account is removed.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We will post the updated policy in the app and update the <code>Effective date</code> above.</p>
